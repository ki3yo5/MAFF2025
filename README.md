## Food Supply Simulation in Japan applying the SWISSfoodSys Model

## Build 2.7 Dec 18 2025
-    variable cropping pattern (rice and wheat based; potato based)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Build 2.6 Nov 26 2025
-    Post-hoc analysis is available by entering any value as the estimated reduction area in yield due to reduced pesticide use.  

## Build 2.5 Nov 24 2025
-  The contstraints on cropping are
         a)  arable land endowments by total acreage and cropping season;
         b)  expansion margin for each crop;
         c)  total fertilizer supply and element usage (constanat or variable) balance; and
         d)  agricultural labor supply and usage balance.
-  The common constraints on all goods are total agricultural labor supply and unit labor demand.

## Build 2.4 Nov 17 2025
-  The contstraints on cropping are a) arable land endowments by total acreage and month; b) expansion margin for each crop; and c) total fertilizer supply and N, P, K balance.  
-  The common constraints on all goods are total agricultural labor supply and unit labor demand.  

## Build 2.3 Feb 16 2025
-  Simultaneous simulation for croping and animal production models with 16 crops, 6 processing foods, 13 feeds, 7 livestocks, 5 animal products and 2 marine products.  
-  Besides baseline scenario (no food and feed import), optional import decline scenario is avialable.  

## Build 2.1 Nov 28 2024
-  Cropping model with 16 crops, 2 marine products, 6 processing foods.  
-  Livestock model with 13 feeds, 7 livestocks, 5 animal products.  
-  Objective function is calorie deficit and food intake balance of 8 food groups.  
-  Contstraints on cropping with arable land endowments and expansion margins for each crops.  
-  Contstraints on livestock production with feed distribution and feed TDN and CP balance.  
-  Simultaneous simulation for croping and animal production models.  
-  Optional module for import decline.  

## Build 1.5 Jan 13 2024
Cropping model with 16 crops, 2 marine products, 6 processing foods.  
Objective function is calorie deficit and nutrient intake balance by 8 food groups.  
The two components are weighted with 4 patterns of weights.  
Contstraints on land size by each type, each month and expansion margins for each crops.  
Calorie and nutrient balance is optimized for per capita per day.  

## Build 1.4 Dec 26 2023
Cropping model with 16 crops, 2 marine products, 6 processing foods.  
Objective function is calorie deficit and nutrient intake balance in difference or rate.  
Contstraints on land size by each type and 300% margin for each cropiing area.  
Cropping on pasture, orchard, local plants are exception.  
Calorie and nutrient balance is optimized for the total population per day.  

## Build 1.3 Dec 24 2023
Cropping model with 16 crops, 2 marine products, 6 processing foods.  
Objective function is calorie deficit and nutrient intake balance only.  
Contstraints on land size by each type and 300% margin for each cropiing area.  
Cropping on pasture, orchard, local plants are exception.  
Calorie and nutrient balance is optimized for the total population per day.  

## Build 1.2 Dec 23 2023
Cropping model with 16 crops but without livestock and processing foods.  
Objective function is calorie deficit and nutrient intake balance only.  
Contstraints on land size by each type and 500% margin for each cropiing area.  
Calorie and nutrient balance is optimized for the total population per day.  

## Build 1.1 Dec 12 2023
Cropping model with 16 crops but without livestock and processing foods.  
Objective function is calorie deficit and nutrient intake balance only.  
Contstraints on pooled land size and 250% margin for each cropiing area.  
Calorie and nutrient balance is optimized for the total population per day.  

## Build 1.0
Simple model with 7 crops and calorie and PCF balance only.  
Contstraints on land size (1ha) only.  
Nutrient balance per day per family (4 adults) is optimized.
