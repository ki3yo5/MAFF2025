## Food Supply Simulation in Japan applying the SWISSfoodSys Model

## Build 2.6 Nov 26 2025
-    Simultaneous simulation for croping and animal production models with 16 crops, 6 processing foods, 13 feeds, 7 livestocks, 5 animal products and 2 marine products.
-    The objective function consists of calorie deficit and net food intake balance of 8 food groups.
-    The contstraints on cropping are
        - arable land endowments by total acreage and cropping season;
        - expansion margin for each crop;
        - total fertilizer supply and element usage (constanat or variable) balance; and
        - agricultural labor supply and usage balance.
-    The contstraints on livestock production are total feed supply and TDN and CP balance.
-    The common constraints on all goods are total agricultural labor supply and unit labor demand.
-    Baseline scenario (current food and feed import) and the import decline scenario is avialable.
-    Post-hoc analysis is available by entering any value as the estimated reduction area in yield due to reduced pesticide use.
